I love playing too, I'm not on a team or anything but I love playing for fun with my friends or even just practicing by myself, usually I go to the ARC, Tuesday and Thursday mornings to play for fun with friends. I play a little bit of video games, such as Roblox, NBA 2K, and I used to play Minecraft a lot before. I love spending time with my loves ones, so my family and friends.
